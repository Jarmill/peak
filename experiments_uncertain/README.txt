This folder contains experiments for the paper
"Peak Estimation for Uncertain and Switched Systems"

A previous notation convention was used when referring to variables. These
symbols are:
t:  time
x:  state
w:  time-independent parametric uncertainty
d:  time-dependent arbitrary uncertainty

test_xue_inner is Fig 1 of the paper, with variables(t, x1, x2).
test_xue_inner.m:   no uncertainty, Fig 1.a
test_xue_inner_w.m: parametric uncertainty, Fig 1.b

three_wave is Fig 2 of the paper, with variables (t, x1, x2, x3)
three_wave.m:           no uncertainty, Fig 2.a
three_wave_w_switch:    (A, B) are time-dependent by switching, 
                        and G has time-independent parametric uncertainty.
                        This is Fig 2.b

three_wave_w:           Only parametric uncertainty. 
three_wave_switch:      Only switching uncertainty

space_1d_test is Fig 3 of the paper (arxiv version) for a spacecraft control
This system features switching in continuous time, with variables (t, x1, x2)
space_1d_test.m:        Deterministic switching, Fig 3.a
space_1d_tst_param.m:   Includes time-independent uncertainty


discrete_d_poly is Fig 4 of the paper (arxiv version) with states (x1,x2)
Subsystem f1 is valid over R^2, and subsystem f2 is valid over x1>=0
discrete_std_poly:       Only switching uncertainty, Fig 4.a
discrete_d_poly:         Includes time-dependent uncertainty in x2
discrete_d_poly:         Includes 2 instances of time-dependent uncertainty
discrete_d:              Time-dependent uncertainty where the switched 
                         systems are both linear

flow_half_safety_d is Fig 5 of the paper (arxiv version)
Demonstrates of trajectories starting from an initial set
with respect to an unsafe half-circle.
flow_half_safety_d.m:    Time-dependent uncertainty, Fig 5.b
